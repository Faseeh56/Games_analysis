## 📊 Analysis Performed

### 🔹 Univariate Analysis
- Analysis of **single variables**
- Studied both **categorical** and **numerical** features
- Identified the **most common game genres**
- Visualized distributions using bar charts and count plots

### 🔹 Bivariate Analysis
- Examined relationships between:
  - Numerical vs Numerical variables
  - Categorical vs Categorical variables
- Used comparative visualizations to highlight trends and differences
